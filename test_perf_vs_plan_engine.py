"""
test_perf_vs_plan_engine.py — checks for the perf-vs-plan definition match (Stage 3).

Run: python3 test_perf_vs_plan_engine.py

  * match_definitions LOGIC (synthetic basis dicts): agreement confirms; a plan-only
    deduction conflicts; a statement-only deduction the model can't confirm is
    'unconfirmed' (proceed-with-caveat); capex-in-opex on the statement conflicts.
  * STATEMENT BASIS on the real samples: the three statements report a sane NOI basis
    (mgmt fee detected where present; capex below NOI, not in opex).

No GPT, no network.
